==================================================

Main program can be executed within folders test/ or testdrag/ testlift/ as the case might be. The important .f90 files of interest will be:

main.f90    --> input parameters and settings (driver program)
monaco.f90  --> statistics and derivatives for UQ/OUU
post.f90    --> post processing on the surrogate (RMSE and other tecplot output coding)
DynamicPointSelection.f90 --> Dynamic training point selection based on local surrogate models	
functions.f90 --> contains test functions, the user can add more.

Subroutine version can be evoked my running ./makelibrary in the main folder that creates krigingestimate.a for Optimization Under Uncertainty.
